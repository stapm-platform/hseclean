\usage{
read_2021(
  root = c("X:/", "/Volumes/Shared/")[1],
  file =
    "HAR_PR/PR/Consumption_TA/HSE/Health Survey for England (HSE)/HSE 2021/UKDA-9319-tab/tab/hse_2021_eul_v1.tab",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{root}{Character string - the root directory. This is the section of the file path to where the data is stored
that might vary depending on how the network drive is being accessed. The default is "X:/",
which corresponds to the University of Sheffield's X drive in the School of Health and Related Research.
Within the function, the root is pasted onto the front of the rest of the file path specified in the 'file' argument.
Thus, if root = NULL, then the complete file path is given in the 'file' argument.}

\item{file}{Character string - the file path and the name and extension of the file. The function has been
designed and tested to work with tab delimited files '.tab'. Files are read by the function [data.table::fread].}

\item{select_cols}{Character string - select either:
"all" - keep all variables in the survey data;
"tobalc" - keep a reduced set of variables associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption and a selected set of
survey design and socio-demographic variables that are needed for the functions within the hseclean package to work.}
}
\value{
Returns a data table.

\description{
Reads and does basic cleaning on the Health Survey for England 2019.

\section{How the data is read and processed}{

The data is read by the function [data.table::fread]. The 'root' and 'file' arguments are
pasted together to form the file path. The following are converted to NA:
c("NA", "", "-1", "-2", "-6", "-7", "-8", "-9", "-90", "-90.0", "-99", "N/A").
All variable names are converted to lower case.
The cluster and probabilistic sampling unit have the year appended to them.
Some renaming of variables is done for consistency with other years.
